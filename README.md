Welcome to the Clips_for_algo_trading. This is a repository for factor/model/data mining during building up algo trading strategy. Most of my ideas are inspired from online resources, papers with adding some 'secret recipe'. All of the clips aim to be strightforward and friendly-readable. 
1. Efficient Frontier:  In this notebook, I tried to create an effcient frontier of a random portfolio.
2. Fama Macbeth: In this notbook, I implemented the Fama Macbeth two step regression, which is a useful method for risk management.
3. Time Series Model to Predict Volatility: I employed a famous time series model GARCH(p,q) to predict the volatility of a specfic stock. It included how to address data, how to pick the hyperparameters, and the fitness of the GARCH(p,q) model.
4. Genearator helper for cross validation: an implementation of cross vaildation to increase usage of data for train/testing sets employed by sklearn machine learning algorithm.
5. Rebalance strategy: The notebook demonstrates a useful function to rebalance portfolio with an example of employing it.
6. A brief for spacy model: An introduction for spaCy model
